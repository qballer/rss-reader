ReadRSS
-------
An RSS client leveraging web components and the bit CLI.
All components are meant to be sharable and utilize the bit cli platform to leverage that.

Why ?
----
For a while now I've been wanting to build an RSS reader which is pure browser and isn't an extension. I've combined this desire with the exploration of a few browser based API and concepts detailed bellow and came up with this. You can use this as a client and as a learning experience as I plan to document all of this in the docs and on medium.

RSS Blog Series

1. Prototyping Web Components - RSS overview - part (1). (events, client, store, elements)
