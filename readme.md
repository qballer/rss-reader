ReadRSS 
-------

An RSS client leveraging web components and the bit CLI. 

Why ? 
---- 
For a while now I've been wanting to build an RSS reader which is pure browser and isn't an extension. I've combined this desire with the exploration of a few browser based API and concepts detailed bellow and came up with this. You can use this as a client and as a learning experience as I plan to document all of this in the docs and on medium.

1. Web Components - elements, shadow dom and more.
2. Worker API. 
3. Client testing with puppeteer. 
4. ES6 modules. 
5. Component based architecture.

Structure: 
1. Docs - containing blog post on the topics above.
2. Assets - Images etc. 
3. Source - containing all components, utilities required to run the app. 
4. tests -
